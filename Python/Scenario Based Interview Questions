3. Scenario: You need to parse logs from multiple services to monitor application performance. How would you achieve this using Python?
Answer:

Libraries:
Loguru: For simplified logging, including structured logs.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for large datasets.
Regex: For pattern matching and extracting relevant information from log files.
Approach:
Read Logs: Use Python’s built-in open() function or pandas.read_csv() if logs are in CSV format.

Build Artifacts: Package the application using setuptools or similar tools.
Deploy: Use Python scripts or tools like Ansible to deploy the application to the desired environment.

6. Scenario: Your team is transitioning to serverless architecture using AWS Lambda. How can Python be utilized in this context?
Answer:

Lambda Functions: Write Python functions to handle events, such as HTTP requests from API Gateway or messages from S3.
Libraries: Use libraries like boto3 for AWS service interactions and requests for external API calls.
Deployment:
AWS SAM: Use the AWS Serverless Application Model to define and deploy serverless applications.
Package: Create deployment packages including your Python code and dependencies.
Monitoring: Integrate CloudWatch for logging and monitoring function execution.

7. Scenario: You need to implement configuration management using Python. How would you go about it?
Answer:

Tools: Use configuration management tools like Ansible (which can be scripted in Python) or write your own scripts.
Configuration File: Use a format like JSON or YAML for configuration files, which can be easily read in Python using json or PyYAML.
Automation:
Scripts: Write Python scripts to read configuration files and apply changes to servers using SSH (with Paramiko) or through APIs.
State Management: Implement a way to track the current state of configurations and handle updates efficiently.

8. Scenario: You want to implement a health check for your application using Python. How would you write a health check script?
Answer:

Libraries: Use Flask or FastAPI to create a simple web service.
Script Structure:
Define Endpoints: Create endpoints like /health that return the application status.
Database Connection Check: Include checks for database connectivity and external service availability.
Response Handling: Return HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 500 for unhealthy) based on the checks.
Deployment: Deploy the health check endpoint as a separate service or alongside your application.

9. Scenario: Your application requires secure access to APIs. How can you manage API keys and secrets in Python?
Answer:

Environment Variables: Store API keys and secrets in environment variables for better security.
Python Libraries:
Python-dotenv: Use this library to load environment variables from a .env file.
AWS Secrets Manager: Use Boto3 to retrieve secrets securely from AWS Secrets Manager.
Accessing Secrets:
Use os.environ to access environment variables.
Use boto3.client('secretsmanager').get_secret_value() to retrieve secrets from AWS.

10. Scenario: You need to create a Python script that interacts with a RESTful API. What are the steps you would follow?
Answer:

Library: Use the Requests library to make HTTP requests.
Define Endpoints: Identify the API endpoints you need to interact with.
Authentication: Implement authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth) based on API requirements.
Make Requests:
Use requests.get() for GET requests, requests.post() for POST requests, etc.
Handle response status codes to check for success or failure.
Error Handling: Use try-except blocks to manage exceptions and log errors.

11. Scenario: Your team needs to generate reports based on application logs. How would you automate this process using Python?
Answer:

Log Parsing: Use Python’s built-in file handling or libraries like pandas to read and process log files.
